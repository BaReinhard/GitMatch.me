Recreating GitMatch.me again, this time using React. Will be implementing cleaner code, and new es6/es7 features, such as async/await, template literals, etc...

This is a work in progress and being built as a team by [Robert Sandor](https://github.com/robertisandor), [Mario Esparza](https://github.com/MarioEsparza), and [Myself](https://github.com/bareinhard)


A working Prototype can be seen at http://bareinhard.net/gitmatch-react
